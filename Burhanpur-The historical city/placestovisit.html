                    Asirgarh Fort, Burhanpur Overview <br>
                    Located in the historical town of Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh,  Asirgarh Fort stands <br> 
                    impegnable in the Satpura Ranges. It was built by the a zamidar (Land owner) knwon as Asa<br>
                    Ahir of the Ahir dynasty in the 15th Century. The fort, spread over a total area of more than<br>
                    60 acres, is situated about 20 kilometres to the north of Burhanpur. It may appear to be a<br> 
                    single large fort, but is, in fact, a colleon of 3 forts known as called Asirgarh,  Karmargarh,<br> 
                    whereas the third part is called Malaygarh.
                    Even though the Asirgarh Fort is now in ruins, <br> it still holds immense importance for history<br> 
                    lovers as well as for those who wish to simply explore the beauty of a monument that once<br> 
                    held esteem and prestige, but unfortunately could not escape the ravages of time. It is<br>
                     known to be an impregnable fort and has never been taken by force!
                    
                     <br>Because the Asirgarh Fort demands a pass through the Satpuras that connects the valleys <br>
                    of the Narmada and the Tapti Rivers, which is one of the most important routes from north<br>
                     India into the Deccan, it is also popularly known as the 'Babe Deccan' or the 'Key to the<br>
                      Deccan'. In fact, during the Mughal era, it was widely agreed that the Deccan started from here,<br>
                       while the area that lay between Asirgarh and Delhi was considered to be Hindustan. <br>
                    
                    The majestic fort was earlier known by the name of Asa Ahir Garh, on account of who built <br>
                    this grand structure. The name of the fort, however, was later changed to its present name.<br>
                     The fort is about 259 metres high and is at the height of 701 metres from the sea level. Inside <br>
                     this grand fort, one can also find a mosque, gurudwara and a temple that is dedicated to<br>
                      Lord Shiva. Legend has it that the fort is haunted by the presence of Ashwattha  - The <br>
                      ill-fated warrior prince from the epic Mahabharata who was doomed with a curse by Lord<br>
                       Krishna that he will remain immortal with no one to care and care for!

                    At a distance of 7 km from Burhanpur Railway Station, the Tomb of Shah Nawaz <br>
                 Khan or Black Taj is a mausoleum located in the Teressa locality of Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh<br>
                    . Situated on the banks of the Utavali River, it is one of the best Burhanpur attractions.<br>

            The Tomb of Shahnawaz Khan is called 'Kala Taj Mahal' or 'Black Taj Mahal' by the locals <br>
            and was built between 1622 and 1623 AD. Shah Nawaz Khan was the eldest son of <br>
            Abdul Rahim Khankhana. He was brought up in Burhanpur itself. Seeing his bravery,<br>
             he was made the commander of the Mughal army. He died at the age of 44, buried <br>
             here on the banks of the Utawali river in Burhanpur. <br>
             It also houses the tomb of Shahnawaz Khan's wife.<br>

            It is a beautiful monument, shaped like the Taj though built on a much <br>
            smaller scale. It is made of locally found black-colored stone hence the<br>
             name Black Taj. Surrounded by a garden, the mausoleum is a big domed structure <br>
             typical of Mughal architecture. The monument is square in shape with a central <br>
             dome and has hexagonal minarets on the four corners with arched verandas running all<br> 
             around it. Inside the walls of the dome have beautiful paintings. But, the actual<br>
              grave of Shah Nawaz Khan is below the Mausoleum and has a small stairway that leads<br>
               to the actual grave. Next to it is a ruined monument called Paandan Mahal because it<br>
                is shaped like a paandan.

The Shahi Qila is a majestic palace in Burhanpur, located to the east of the Tapti River. <br>
History of the Shahi Qila states that it was originally built by the Farooqui rulers and resided <br>
by Shah Jahan, at a time when he was the governor of Burhanpur. Shah Jahan became so fond<br>
 of the fort that it was here, in Shahi Qila that he establishes his court for the<br>
  first three years of his ascending the throne.Shah Jahan spent a considerable <br>
  time in this city, and helped add to the Shahi Qila. Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas <br>
  were built on the terrace of the Qila.<br>
<br>
<br>
The main attraction at the palace is the hamam or the royal bath.<br>
 It was specifically built for Shah Jahan’s wife, Begum Mumtaz Mahal, so that she could<br>
  enjoy a luxurious bath in water scented with khus, saffron and rose petals.<br>
   Hammam Khana was constructed during Mughal Period.

One of the amazing <br>facts is that the Taj Mahal was originally supposed to have been built at Burhanpur.<br>
 The site chosen for it still lies vacant near the tapti river. Mumtaz, in whose memory <br>the Taj Mahal
 was built, died in burhanpur while giving birth to her fourteenth child<br>
